        <h2>All About Ebony</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my bioSite. My project is dedicated to my cousin and best friend, Ebony M. Cooley. Everybody calls her princess but its been my highest honor watching her grow into the young woman she is today. I felt using her for this project would help motivate me to put my best effort into this assignment and also show her some appreciation. She's been working so hard pursuing her goals and I hope this is just a sign for her to keep going.</p>

    <h1>Ebony Marie Cooley <br> From a Princess to a Queen!</h1>
    <p>I have had the pleasure of getting to know one and grow with an angel on Earth. This angel is my bestfriend, Ebony. She's always so hard on herself and I wanted to show her how much I think of her and her impact on those around her.
    Ebony is a living representation of femininity, vulnerability, kindness, and selflessness. She is my inspiration and I can only dream of being as angelic as her!</p>

    <h1>Life Through Her Eyes</h1>
    <p>The affects each stage of life had on Ebony's development..</p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="life-col">
            <h3>Childhood</h3>
            <p>First born to two married parents whom had been together since childhood, Ebony was excited at the news of her becoming a big sister. Her parents welcomed a baby boy into the world! This stage of life is where she developed her nurturing, protective, and loving skills. It was also at this stage of life where Ebony experienced tragic loss and grief losing both her maternal and paternal grandmothers and to soon follow her 4 year-old brother Terrance to cancer. </p></p>
        </div>
        <div class="life-col">
            <h3>Teen-hood</h3>
            <p>Wounded but faithful, Ebony and her parents relocated to Texas from New Orleans where they welcomed another son and daughter into their family. Her mom picked up more shifts while still in school and her dad was consistently on the road driving trucks. This forced Ebony to step up as the mother figure for her siblings and reopened her heart to love. She found resilience and hope in trusting in God. She realized that when she lost her brother all she wanted was more time with him and now with her new siblings that was all she had with them. This is where her positive outlook on life comes from, as from this moment on she was determined to see the good in every situation.</p></p>
        </div>
        <div class="life-col">
            <h3>Adulthood</h3>
            <p>Ebony was always having to be responsible and a good example for her younger siblings so she never got into the usual trouble most kids do. This is where Ebony starts experimenting with freedom and discovering her self, her interests and dislikes. Watching Ebony bloom into adulthood is no different than watching a romcom and everyone's rooting for the main character to win. She's funny, innocent, unpredictable and completely out of the loop and that is her advantage!  </p>
